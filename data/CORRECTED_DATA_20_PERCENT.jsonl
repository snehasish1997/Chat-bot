interest stage of the funding opportunity. submission of an expression of interest is mandatory for those who wish to apply to the full funding opportunity. to be eligible for the full funding opportunity you must complete the expression of interest smart survey providing: your name and contact details project title the key area of renewable energy research that best fits your proposal and a brief summary of your proposal that must be no more than 200 words including how it enhances ukris current renewable energy portfolio this information is to assist us with pre-approaching reviewers. expressions of interest will not be assessed. this is an expression of interest for new network+ proposals to discover and develop the next generation of renewable energy technologies and put the uk at the forefront of these areas of technology. the importance of renewable energy technologies has been shown by both the net zero research and innovation framework and the committee for climate change as a key component of the uks 2050 net zero target and has formed the backbone of epsrc strategy in energy & decarbonisation for many years. the supergen programme is our energy and decarbonisation themes largest coordinated investment across several grants. the programme was set up in 2001 to deliver sustained and coordinated research on sustainable power generation and supply. to support this mission, as we move into the next phase of the programme, our focus is on accelerating the impact from known renewable power generation and supply technologies through the supergen offshore renewable energy, bioenergy, and energy networks hubs whilst also ensuring the uk is at the forefront of the next generation of renewable energy technologies. this funding opportunity is intended to create coherence in emerging areas of renewable energy research to drive forward research in sustainable power generation and supply to give the uk a lead in the next generation of these technologies. this investment is a major component of our engineering net zero mission-inspired priority and is aimed at investing in the high risk and high reward research to discover and develop the next generation of renewable energy technologies. this funding opportunity is intended to deliver outcomes that align to the priorities within ukris building a green future strategic theme, as well as the uks net zero research and innovation framework (gov.uk) and the british energy security strategy (gov.uk). the next phase of the supergen programme is intended to build a diverse, inclusive, and interdisciplinary research and innovation community working across ukri, academia, business, government and the public and international partners to create lasting and sustainable benefits for all. the purpose of each network+ will be to bring together a community and develop a research agenda for a proposed area in next generation renewable energy technologies and which provide an opportunity to secure uk leadership with greater levels of coordination and research activity. proposals should focus on technology areas that already exist with some critical mass. each network+ will aim to create coherence in a research area that is currently absent and will thus enable a future bid to compete for supergen hub funding and should include industry engagement in their planning. two to three of these network+ investments may then be taken forward as the next generation of supergen hubs (subject to funding). network+ proposals should focus on an emerging area of renewable energy technology that will enhance ukris energy and decarbonisation portfolio and ensure that next generation renewable technologies are more environmentally sustainable than previous approaches. proposals from areas that are currently or have previously been part of the supergen programme must therefore be substantially different to previously funded work or they will not be considered. the current supergen portfolio consists of three hubs: offshore renewable energy, bioenergy, energy networks and two network+s: solar technologies and energy storage. duration the duration of this award is 2- 2.5

to submit a single collaborative proposal that will undergo a single review process by the lead agency, on behalf of both nsf/bio and bbsrc. in 2023 to 2024, proposals will be accepted for uk and us collaborative projects in the areas of intersection between nsf/bio and bbsrc as set out in the notice of intentions. proposals must address the priorities of both bbsrc and participating nsf/bio divisions. you must provide a clear rationale for the need for a us and uk collaboration, including the unique expertise and synergy that the collaborating groups will bring to the project. the lead agency opportunity does not represent new funding. proposals will be assessed in competition with all others submitted to the priority areas and agency programs identified in this call and outcomes will be subject to both success in merit review and the availability of funds from both bbsrc and nsf/bio. areas of focus proposals relevant to the following priority areas and agency programs are eligible to apply for this funding opportunity. you are invited to submit proposals under one of the following research themes: synthetic cells and cellular systems can we design, build and control a synthetic cell or synthetic cellular system? natural cells emerge from the coordinated operation of a large number of biomolecules with their environment. one goal of synthetic cell research is to decipher the basic requirements of a living cell by understanding the myriad functions that make it resilient and adaptive. similarly, synthetic approaches to building multicellular systems may reveal new mechanistic understanding of how both biophysical and biochemical intercellular interactions drive spatial organisation and emergent behaviour within cell populations. proposals are expected to focus on building a synthetic cell or cellular system to understand biology. synthetic cells might be: protocells containing only the most basic cellular components that allow an understanding of the origin of life artificial cells that contain both natural and synthetic cellular components minimal cells that use natural molecules to build self-replicating cellular entities through bottom up approaches synthetic multi-cellular systems would couple engineering at a cellular level to the development of higher order spatially organised structures, through control of cellular interactions, geometries, movement and collective behaviours. proposals with a focus on synthetic plant cells and cellular systems research are welcome. exclusions proposals focused exclusively on building a synthetic cell as a biomanufacturing platform or as a therapeutic moiety will not be accepted biomedically-focused proposals such as regenerative medicine and tissue engineering will also not be accepted depending on the choice of lead agency, full proposals will be submitted to and assessed by either: nsf 23-548 division of molecular and cellular biosciences: investigator initiated research projects bbsrc responsive mode 24rm2 synthetic microbial communities microbial communities contain remarkable genetic, physiological and biochemical diversity, allowing them to flourish in environments all over the planet and in a variety of substrates and hosts. while the means of harnessing individual microbes for biotechnological application are well established, in recent years researchers have begun to explore the wider properties and potential of more complex mixed microbial communities. the study of natural microbiomes can be hampered by their inherent complexity and an inability to fully map how the functional properties of their constituents combine to deliver a collective phenotype. advances in synthetic biology and allied fields are enabling researchers to assemble and engineer synthetic microbial communities from a bottom-up perspective that have novel compositions, genetics and phenotypes. this offers an alternative to natural microbiomes, allowing researchers to address more precisely fundamental questions about complex microbial communities while also providing routes towards novel bio-based solutions to societal problems. proposals are invited to support research that: examines the underlying mechanisms or rules that can be used to inform the construction, maintenance and evolution of synthetic microbial communities, considering factors such as: cooperative and competitive interactions within communities emergent properties within these systems examines how to design and control increasing complexity in microbial composition, considering: behaviours genetic, metabolic, signalling and physical interactions that occur how these properties may change within differently spatially structured environments or as processes are scaled to enable practical application builds complex mixed synthetic communities with novel physiological and metabolic outputs, offering potential bio-based solutions that contribute to tackling global challenges such as: production of novel biochemical cycles to enable more circular use of resources in the bioeconomy, biodegradation of recalcitrant or forever chemicals development of biorenewable resources that could mitigate our impact on the environment and climate all proposals should expand our understanding of biological systems, even if an application is proposed. exclusions proposals focused exclusively on biomedical or therapeutic applications will not be accepted depending on the choice of lead agency, full proposals will be submitted to and assessed by either: nsf

biological informatics proposals should develop informatics approaches and cyberinfrastructure resources to enable novel and more effective use of data in biological research. proposals should address important current or emerging challenges faced by researchers, supporting generation of new knowledge from biological data. proposals should clearly identify their relevance to one of two biological informatics focus areas, either: research to design novel or greatly improved research tools and methods the implementation of, scaling of, or major improvements to research tools, products, and services for biology applicable to a wide range of researchers proposals can be in any bioinformatics research area within the remit of both nsf/bio and bbsrc. proposals should clearly describe their potential to advance and enable data driven research undertaken by biological research communities primarily supported by both nsf/bio and bbsrc. proposals must be aligned to nsf/bios division of biological infrastructure informatics (innovation) or cyberinfrastructure (capacity) programmes, but not both. principal investigators are advised to consult the appropriate programme officers of both agencies to ensure that their portion of the project is compliant with the targeted program. depending on the choice of lead agency, full proposals will be submitted to and assessed by either: nsf 23-578 infrastructure innovation for biological research (innovation) nsf 23-580 infrastructure capacity for biology core program (capacity) bbsrc responsive mode 24rm2 understanding host-microbe interactions proposals are invited that address questions relating to infection and infection-like processes. host-microbe interactions can result in a range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic outcomes for the host. indeed, some interactions could be beneficial to the host/and other infectious agent. the goal is to identify and understand these interactions in plants or animals as the first step towards harnessing infection biology to solve societal problems. this announcement calls for studies that propose investigations that shape our understanding of infection and infection-like processes in complex multi-faceted scenarios such as: modulation of host-microbe interactions in response to varied environmental conditions the influence of co-infection and the wider microbiome, both in initial responses and in influencing the dynamics of longer-term interactions how changes to host physiology through the life course may alter susceptibility or resistance to infection; and host or microbial factors that contribute towards fundamental shifts in the nature of infections, such as transitions between commensal, mutualistic and pathogenic outcomes relevant areas of investigation include: using genetically similar hosts or microbes that result in different phenotypic outcomes of infection; or the use of comparative cross-species approaches to develop insights that have broad relevance across biological organisms proposals must aim to progress knowledge of immunology in either non-human, non-mouse animals or plants, through integration of a range of approaches and data across the host-microbe interface to develop new systems-level insights. exclusions proposals that focus solely on human or mouse immune systems will not be accepted proposals that focus on industrial applications will not be accepted depending on the choice of lead agency, full proposals will be submitted to and assessed by either: nsf 23-547 division of integrative organismal systems core program

ways in which social violence, specifically sex and gbv, manifests and can be addressed using arts and humanities-led interdisciplinary approaches. projects will seek to understand the drivers behind gbv to develop sustainable methods of prevention, safeguarding and behavioural change. it is recognised that gbv is a global issue and needs to be tackled as such. while the focus of this funding opportunity is on working with partners in low and middle income countries, we welcome approaches that would enable lessons learnt in addressing gbv across the globe. issues concerning accessibility and inclusion should be addressed throughout the application with the inclusion of diverse voices. this funding opportunity responds to and builds on a wealth of related research funded through the global challenges research fund (gcrf) and one of ahrcs where next reports. it also complements related global initiatives such as the foreign and commonwealth development offices what works to prevent violence programme. see additional info for more about these initiatives. your application should have a focus on contexts in low and middle income countries on the development assistance committee (dac) list. note that the primary focus of research cannot be india or china for this funding opportunity, see section on official development assistance for further guidance. research projects supported through this funding opportunity are expected to: develop arts and humanities-led interdisciplinary approaches and interventions that will contribute to gbv prevention, response and recovery expand the current evidence base for gbv research and interventions by focusing on current and historical contexts, including: how covid-19 and post-covid contexts have exacerbated gender-based violence and further diminished gender equality (including all gender identities) recent increases in human trafficking how conflict, climate, economic or humanitarian crises have increased risks of violence, especially for the most vulnerable populations or groups consider how different contexts result in different manifestations, for example private and public, rural and urban spaces, conflict and post-conflict contexts consider how evidence and research methodologies can be applied across southern contexts as well as to relevant northern contexts. this includes opportunities that support two-way south-south and south-north learning boundary crossing proposals which support the development of interdisciplinary perspectives connecting within and beyond the arts and humanities, and engagement with policy, practice and civil society are encouraged. we welcome creative and innovative impacts and outcomes that are relevant to the intended beneficiaries of the research, and tailored interventions that meet the needs of particular groups. to support research creativity and innovation, we will accept a wide range of topics and approaches for this funding opportunity, provided that they meet the overall aims and scope outlined above. examples of research areas emerging from engagement activities in the development of this funding opportunity and from current activities under the ahrc gbv portfolio, which research projects could seek to address, include but are not limited to: an understanding of what constitutes violence, in particular cultural contexts and the importance of linguistic nuances when talking about gbv intersectional or systems approaches to gbv how gbv interacts with other forms of violence and how one kind of violence can spill over to another how different individuals or groups experience gbv and how arts-based interventions can be developed, tailored and adapted for local needs historic and spatial dimensions of gbv, including how post-colonial power structures, and structural inequalities have evolved over time impact opportunities for and with both local communities and policy makers how laws, legal frameworks or limited access to justice systems can exacerbate the experience of gbv sustainable prevention of gbv, for example through innovative educational and community initiatives in addition, we are looking for research projects which: reflect the heterogeneity of gbv through voices and experience recognise the intersecting factors that shape experience, including issues such as discrimination, power, protection of human rights, access to justice, violence, displacement, conflict and fragility consider all gender identities support participatory or co-researched approaches which are inclusive of the voices, ideas and experiences of survivors of gbv, either directly or indirectly embed equitable partnerships embed and exemplify accessible, inclusive and sustainable working practices fully address ethical and safeguarding issues generate a variety of context-sensitive innovative impacts and outcomes proposals can develop new ideas and partnerships that address research gaps or expand on previous work in a relevant area. where proposals build on existing partnerships, you will need to clarify how they will add value to them and develop new collaborations, for example by expanding their international reach. equitable partnerships and collaboration we are looking for proposals that embed principles of equitable partnership working into the design, delivery and dissemination of research. projects must include collaboration between researchers and wider partners from outside of academia, which may include: community groups non-governmental organisations civil society organisations creative, cultural and heritage sectors relevant local partners charities policy making bodies the nature of collaboration and partnership should be balanced and appropriate to the aims of the project as well as local contexts. your application must demonstrate how the project team will ensure an equitable, collective and inclusive approach to partnership, including co-design and co-delivery of research and outcomes. the balance of intellectual leadership between researchers and partners involved should also be equitable. read further guidance on principles of equitable partnership working. please see ahrcs funding guide for information on including project partners and sub-contractors in your application. if costs are included for a project partner or sub-contractor, this can be paid at 100% if it is counted as part of research costs linked to an international co-investigator (see funding available). safeguarding and ethical research full consideration should be given to the relevant collaborating countrys context and ethical issues in the planning and conduct of research, implementing a do no harm duty of care approach. this includes languages, cultures, faiths, public engagement, legal frameworks, political and regulatory systems. proposals must fully address ethical and safeguarding issues, referring to local guidance and regulations where applicable. ethical considerations are amplified in spaces of fragility and violence, requiring additional reflection and safeguarding when planning research. a toolkit (pdf, 335kb) for those involved in planning research in fragile and conflict-affected contexts has been developed via ukri and unicef. you are strongly encouraged to consult this document when planning your research. ukris preventing harm in research page outlines our key principles for safeguarding and preventing harm in research. ukri also has wider guidance on safeguarding, ethics and expectations around due diligence. see research in a global setting for further guidance. as this funding opportunity is aimed at international development research, we expect researchers to consider and act on this guidance. official development assistance (oda) this funding opportunity is part of the uks oda commitment. this is government aid that promotes and specifically targets the economic development and welfare of developing countries. successful awards under this funding opportunity will be supported via oda funding, as such projects must demonstrate how they are oda compliant and will contribute to the economic development and welfare of developing countries. your research must relate to countries on the dac list of oda recipients. any proposal to this funding opportunity must make it clear that its primary purpose is to promote the economic development and welfare of a developing country or countries. your application should: seek to investigate a specific problem or seek a specific outcome which will have an impact on a developing country or countries on the dac list provide evidence as to why this is a problem for the developing country or countries address the issue identified effectively and efficiently use the strengths of the uk to address the issue, working in collaboration with others as appropriate demonstrate that the research is of an internationally excellent standard identify appropriate pathways to impact to ensure that the developing country benefits from the research any benefit to the uk or other developed countries has to be the secondary consideration and should not lead to a project being funded if it doesnt primarily deliver the development objective. please note the following exceptions to eligible partner countries: ukris partnerships with india have a renewed focus for oda funding opportunities. the outcomes and outputs of any applications involving india must have a primary benefit outside the uk or india, benefitting other countries on the dac list of oda recipients as the direct and primary objective. secondary benefits to india and the uk are possible. where india is involved in an oda funded project, it should not be the sole or primary beneficiary of the activity from 2023, ukri is unable to support research and innovation partnerships with china on any oda funded activity. as such, the beneficiary of your proposed activity must not be china. researchers or other partners based at chinese organisations are not eligible to apply in any capacity and no research activity should take place in or benefit china. no oda funded research and innovation activity can take place in china applicants working with partners in in india or china who wish to apply for this funding opportunity are strongly advised to contact ahrc for guidance as early as possible. equality, diversity and inclusion oda funds provided by ukri must comply with the gender equality and other requirements of the international development act. under the international development (gender equality) act 2014, development assistance should be provided in a way that is likely to contribute to reducing inequality between persons of different gender. you should consider the potential for positive impacts in gender equality. any possible negative impacts of the proposed project on inequalities of different genders, and how the project proposes to remove these, should also be considered. these considerations need to be presented in a gender equality statement, which will be assessed. additionally, you are encouraged, where appropriate, to extend the statement to cover intersecting and wider issues relating to equalities, diversity, identities and inclusion. this includes consideration of the un sustainable development no-one left behind agenda as well as any context-specific factors which need to be taken into account in addressing issues of gender and inequalities. read further guidance on writing your gender equality statement (pdf, 538kb). this guidance was issued as part of previous gcrf and newton fund opportunities but is also relevant for this funding opportunity. duration the maximum duration of this award is 36 months. projects must start on 1 february 2024. each project will have an initial six-month period for networking, partnership development and project set up before the core research activities are expected to begin. the six-month networking stage will allow for activities including: refinement of plans and research areas for delivery partnership development activities incorporating reviewer feedback (where appropriate) project set up activities workshops and other networking activity planning meetings your application should have a clear idea of the overall research questions, aims and objectives from the outset and the networking phase will allow for refinement as well as partnership building to support those aims. towards the end of the networking phase, you will be required to submit a short progress report that shows how plans have been refined. a light-touch review of progress reports will be carried out by ahrc towards the end of the networking phase. feasibility of the application to progress from networking to the core research phase is a key assessment criterion for this funding opportunity. it is not expected that substantial changes will be made to projects between the networking and research phases, but refinement of plans and partnerships is acceptable. we expect to support 10 to 12 awards through this funding opportunity. throughout their duration, the cohort of project teams will be convened to share learning and findings. the exact nature and frequency of this will be determined with the project teams. funding available the fec of your project can be up to 400,000. ahrc will fund: 80% of the fec for uk-based researchers 100% of the fec for eligible international co-investigator costs all

priorities for fellowships using echild (pdf, 368kb). data first: cross-justice system linked dataset data first is an ambitious data-linking programme led by the ministry of justice (moj) and funded by adr uk. data already shared under data first has linked criminal justice administrative datasets held by moj, including datasets from its executive agencies such as hm prison and probation service and hm courts and tribunals service. the latest release from data first is the creation of a cross-justice system linked dataset. this new linked dataset brings together family and civil courts data for the first time, and links to datasets already available under data first. the dataset allows researchers a unique opportunity to study interactions across the justice system for the first time, and to deliver vital evidence on individual journeys across the justice system. read our research priorities for fellowships using the data first cross-justice system linked dataset (pdf, 263kb). other new or updated flagship datasets in scope we would also like to highlight the following updates to our flagship datasets. family court  cafcass linked to census 2021 (england and wales  sail) the data first family court  cafcass linked dataset will soon be available linked to census 2021 in the sail databank cafcass stands for children and family court advisory and support service. the de-identified dataset contains information on marriage and divorce characteristics, adoption, public law and private law cases and their legal outcomes in england and wales. the updated datasets bring the family court data up to march 2023 and the cafcass data up to january 2023. the census data has been provided in full for england and wales to sail databank with the exception of travel to work and sexual orientation information. full census documentation is expected soon; please check the brochure for updates and ensure you access the latest version. in the meantime, we encourage applicants

wales  sail) longitudinal educational outcomes (england)  new additions the longitudinal education outcomes (leo) dataset provides unparalleled insights into educational experiences and labour market outcomes of the english public. it combines the education, earnings and benefits data records of the whole population from 1985 onward. this enables rich longitudinal analysis of the outcome of peoples education and if relevant, their interaction with the care system as children. we can investigate the impact that these outcomes have had on peoples lives in relation to their later earnings, taxation, and receipt of benefits. the capacity to analyse these longer-term labour market outcomes together, at person level, enables assessment of education policy and provision with much greater detail and accuracy than ever before. the vast range of valuable insights that can be drawn from this dataset remains largely untapped, and this is an exciting opportunity to facilitate more urgently needed research outcomes. the latest additions to leo are to be made available imminently to accredited researchers via the ons secure research service. this includes the addition of industry data, ucas data and covid-19 data among other valuable updates. it is expected that a third iteration of the service will be made available to users during the length of the fellowship, and updated data would be available for researchers to access once available. read our research priorities for fellowships using the leo linked dataset (pdf, 270kb). moj  dfe linked dataset: refresh to include data up to 2021 the ministry of justice (moj)  department for education (dfe) linked dataset provides de-identified data on childhood characteristics and education outcomes of young people linked to data on their interactions with the criminal justice system. the shared information consists of data on the educational characteristics of young people, from dfe, linked to data on their interactions with the criminal justice system, from moj. the data includes those offenders with at least one record from 2000 or later, who were on the police national computer at the end of 2021 and were matched to individuals on the national pupil database. only offenders who were born on, or after 31 august 1985 were matched, because earlier groups do not have a realistic chance of matching. the earliest year shared will cover those aged 16 during the 2001/02 academic year, the oldest group likely to be present in the national pupil database. read our research priorities for fellowships using the moj-dfe

disciplines, where many major research challenges exist. priority areas this funding opportunity is to support training courses in the following areas: priority areas of identifiable training need relevant to nerc remit priority areas can include both specific and transferable skills, such as: mentoring project management diversity, equity and inclusion (dei) training you should provide justification for the training topic. you will be assessed against this criterion alongside training excellence and demonstrating a commitment to dei with equal weighting. please refer to the nerc best practice principles in doctoral recruitment which sets out the minimum considerations for training grant holders. all initiatives must demonstrate both the need and demand for the training it intends to support and provide appropriate evidence. for example, identifying a training area where training is not support by the nerc doctoral programmes (doctoral training partnerships and centres for doctoral training) but where there is a recognised demand for these skills. nerc particularly encourages initiatives that provide significant added value to other nerc priorities or investments, such as: nercs strategic research programmes nerc remit areas related to the ukri strategy find out about the training nerc supports through its doctoral programmes. what we will not fund funding will not be provided through this funding opportunity to support currently funded training. it is expected that you will not duplicate but instead complement existing training supported through other nerc awards. initiatives that do not adequately demonstrate both need and demand for their proposed training will not be considered for funding. training initiatives training initiatives may take a variety of forms (including but not extensively): short courses workshops field courses e-learning, webinars, massive open online courses summer schools etc. read examples of current nerc research centre training courses. training initiatives may form part of an accredited: continuing professional development postgraduate certificate diploma all initiatives must offer places as priority to nerc-funded phd students or ukri-funded environmental scientists, or both. students or scientists must be working within academic or non-academic settings for future careers in research and other contexts. places can also be available to those working in a sector or discipline aligned to nercs science remit. places can also be offered to current or past nerc-funded phd students to fill training and skills gaps created by the covid-19 pandemic. please note, nerc fellows (for example, independent research fellowships) and nerc-sponsored fellows (for example, nerc daphne jackson trust fellows) are considered to be eligible for places. where there is competition for course places between priority candidates, or between non-priority candidates, the grant holder should offer places to applicants according to the applicant training need and impact that receiving the training will have on them. nerc expects you to engage as appropriate with relevant non-academic stakeholders, particularly users of nerc research, when developing and delivering training. this engagement will be considered during the assessment process. funding there is a total budget of 750,000 available for the scheme and nerc intends to support approximately 10 to 15 awards. all costs will be funded at 100%. the maximum that you can apply for to run a training initiative is 60,000, although it is expected that most training initiatives will request 20,000 to 50,000 in total. you may however request up to 100,000 with further justification. funding above 60,000 will be awarded at the discretion of the panel. fieldwork courses will be more expensive than remote courses, this assumes no further lockdown and travel is possible. failure to provide additional justification will limit the amount of funding awarded to a maximum of 60,000. funding should be calculated on a per attendee (place on the training course) basis and applications may request up to 10,000 in justified direct costs per attendee. although it is expected that most initiatives will require between 1,000 to 3,000 per attendee and proposals will normally look to fund between 10 to 30 attendees. the cost per attendee requested should include, where appropriate, support for travel and subsistence costs for attendees to attend the training. funding to cover staff travel, subsistence costs, venue hire, materials and consumables can be included. funding to cover staff salary can be included in the cost per attendee calculation. staff salary requested can cover time spent preparing and delivering the training course. indirect and estate costs must not be included. you must provide a breakdown of costs for their proposed training to enable the panel to assess the costs associated with the proposed training at a per attendee level and identify costs requested under each heading. applications that fail to provide this information will not be considered by the assessment panel and rejected for this funding opportunity. the assessment panel may recommend to nerc that individual costs, or the overall cost of an application, be reduced prior to making an offer of award. these awards are cash limited and

can include global health trials from phase 2b (efficacy) onwards implementation and scale-up research health systems, health policy and health economics research we also welcome cross-sector research combining expertise to meet a global health challenge. for example, a single proposal may include aspects of urban planning, health policy and non-communicable disease research. the research question might involve different disciplines and approaches from outside the health sector, but the primary objective must be health focused. we will accept applications of all sizes from 150,000, including large applications of approximately 2 million and small to medium-scale applications. we will take into account value for money when assessing applications. the resources you request should be appropriate for the objectives of your application you can apply for funding to address any health topic of relevance in the context where the research will be conducted. examples of areas in which applied research may be conducted include, but are not limited to, the following: maternal and neonatal health early childhood development adolescent health healthy ageing sexual and reproductive health infectious diseases, including neglected tropical diseases and covid-19 non-communicable diseases, including mental health disorders multimorbidity nutrition and food security snakebite

strengthening research capacity as part of your application we are committed to strengthening research capacity within lmics and the uk. all applicants are required to develop plans to strengthen research capacity within their proposal, which will be assessed as part of the peer review process and inform funding decisions. we encourage you to start discussing capacity strengthening priorities as early as possible, in consultation with key stakeholders, both within and outside of your project team. for example: researchers laboratory technicians data collectors field workers managers practitioners policymakers research management offices we take a broad view of where capacity strengthening activities could be targeted, however plans must be directly linked to the proposed project. activities could target the individual, institutional or contextual level (or span multiple levels), and plans should be proportionate to the scale of the project, with larger proposals expected to be more ambitious. examples of capacity building include, but are not limited to: building leadership skills amongst early career researchers opportunities for mutual learning across the project team, such as through staff exchanges (for example, the context where it is being conducted in the subject of the research, engagement with policymakers and research management) building capacity to working collaboratively, across disciplines and across practice-research boundaries (for example, with policymakers, managers and practitioners in the system) providing mentoring to improve the capacity of less-experienced researchers to generate new knowledge and achieve policy impact team members attending training courses to develop specific expertise or obtain relevant qualifications (excluding masters and phds) opportunities for staff and associated health managers to author or co-author journal and conference papers and participate in national and international conferences building organisational capacity (for example, in management, finance or communications) formation of lmics research networks uk collaborative on development research (ukcdr) provide further resources, tools
