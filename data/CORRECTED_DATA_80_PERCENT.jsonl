opportunity supports research that exploits existing data resources for social and economic research. applicants have considerable flexibility to focus on any subject area or topic providing that it falls within the esrcs remit. proposed research is not required to use esrc-funded data resources, though this is encouraged. this funding opportunity also aims to develop the capacity and skills of social sciences communities in using large and complex existing data resources. we encourage partnerships with non-academic stakeholders to ensure generation of high-impact, policy- and practitioner-relevant research. proposals can draw from the wider sciences, but the social sciences must represent more than 50% of the research focus and effort. we will work with other research councils to ensure that applications close to remit boundaries are assessed by the most appropriate lead council. for a full list of esrc disciplines, or if you are unsure whether your project is suitable for esrc funding, please check the eligibility of your proposal. ambitious and novel research proposals addressing new concepts and techniques are encouraged, as are those with the potential for significant scientific or societal and economic impact. fresh ideas from new researchers are also encouraged, and proposals are welcomed from early career researchers. duration the duration of this award is up to two years (24 months). funding available the full economic cost of your project must not exceed 300,000. we will fund 80% of the full economic cost. what we will fund funding can support: research projects that use qualitative or quantitative data from at least one existing uk or international data resource methodological development researchers at different career stages what we will not fund applications cannot be accepted under this funding opportunity for: primary data collection unspecified research work research that will have been carried out before the grant start date writing up previous research literature surveys conference attendance, other than within an award travel for general study expeditions requests to hold conferences, workshops or seminars preparation of books and publications preparation and production of materials such as curriculum materials and software development where these constitute the primary project component associated studentships cannot be funded under this funding opportunity. supporting skills and talent we will be looking for evidence of a strong commitment to supporting the development of researchers at all stages of their career. we encourage you to follow the principles of the concordat to support the career development of researchers and the technician commitment. we expect this to include a strong career development programme, shaped to suit the stage of the researchers career and providing increased opportunities for professional development. this should include, but not be limited to, the early career stage. increasing capacity contributes to the quality and impact of the research. we encourage you to consider how you can support capacity building for all members of the project team. esrc-funded data infrastructure we support a range of data infrastructure. we encourage applicants to consider whether the use of these resources could add value to their project. please find more details about the datasets available across the uk on facilities and resources. details of datasets and infrastructure to be used in your project should be given in the facilities section. new datasets primary data collection will not be funded under this opportunity. however, where new datasets are created by the linkage of existing resources (which is permissible under this opportunity), applicants are required to include a data management plan which discusses how this data will be stored and shared. impact, innovation and interdisciplinarity we expect applicants to consider the

(projects combining approaches from more than one discipline). knowledge exchange and collaboration we are committed to knowledge exchange and encouraging collaboration between researchers and the private, public and civil society sectors. collaborative working benefits both the researchers and the individuals/organisations involved. through collaboration, partners learn about each others expertise, share knowledge and gain an appreciation of different professional cultures. collaborative activity can therefore lead to a better understanding of the ways that academic research can add value and offer insights to key issues of concern for policy and practice. knowledge exchange should not be treated as an add-on at the end of a project but considered before the start and built into a project. equitable partnership principles when undertaking research and innovation activities outside the uk, you must recognise and address the possible impact of contextual, societal and cultural differences on the ethical conduct of those activities. researchers should also follow the principles of equitable partnerships to address inherent power imbalances when working with partners in resource-poor settings. applying the principles will encourage equitable access, especially in low- and middle-income countries (lmics), while maintaining incentives for innovation. you should consider the principles from the start of the research and development cycle. read ukris guidance on research in a global setting. trusted research if your application includes international applicants, project partners or collaborators, visit trusted research for more information on protection of those working in our thriving and collaborative international research and innovation sector. research ethics we require that the research we support is designed and conducted in such a way that it meets ethical principles and is subject to proper professional and institutional

communities from across the research and development system to identify, prioritise and develop emerging research and knowledge exchange challenges. it provides leadership across disciplines and sectors, continues to expand its connections and relationships throughout the duration of its funding, and tailors its activities to the needs in its area. a network plus is expected to establish and maintain appropriate links with relevant activities and research users to achieve its aims of increasing collaborative working across disciplines and sectors, providing visibility and accessibility, and connecting the research and innovation landscape. the funding for this network plus call is from the ukri strategic theme on building a secure and resilient world (bsrw) which aims to strengthen social and economic resilience, and enhance national security across virtual and physical environments, by improving awareness of risks and threats, preparedness, informed decision-making and response. it will work towards change being understood as a force for good. focus behavioural science can answer fundamental questions about how and why people, organisations and groups behave in the way they do within societal and economic contexts. huge volumes of data on individual and population level behaviour, movements, and interactions with systems and services are being collected through global navigation satellite systems (gnss), radio-frequency identification (rfid), surveillance and location applications, and other emerging technologies, creating new opportunities for behavioural research. advances in machine learning, artificial intelligence (ai), data science, and language, speech and vision analysis offer new ways of using these data to improve understanding of how populations react in situations of conflict, disaster or threat; how soldiers, police officers and first responders behave in active situations; and how emerging threats and risks can be identified and mitigated. the ukri behavioural science for security and defence network plus will, through theory-led, data-driven approaches, enable new understanding of how individual and population level risks evolve. drawing together a wide and diverse network of researchers and relevant stakeholders, the network will: improve understanding of human behaviours in uncertain and high-risk scenarios by exploiting new forms of data and methods harness understanding of population-level variation in resilience and vulnerabilities and the factors that affect this, improving predictions and prevention of future security threats and helping shape responses to future threat scenarios advance theory-based data analytics, modelling and predictive algorithms for predicting threats, shocks, large-scale instabilities, the behaviour of hostile actors and the radicalisation of vulnerable groups facilitate new opportunities for managing risk, informing decision making in conflict situations, countering emerging technological threats and increasing resilience to insecurities inform evidence-based decision making through timely, high impact, and independent research on human behaviour that meets the needs of policymakers, government departments and other national security organisations and stakeholders the network plus will bring together expertise from a broad range of disciplinary perspectives both within the behavioural and social sciences and from other disciplines such as engineering, computing, design and health sciences. the network plus will undertake the following activities: engage and network with other ukri activities and stakeholders in academia, industry and government in the uk and internationally, connecting and coordinating across a diverse range of disciplines and backgrounds assess and determine what the uk needs in terms of research, research infrastructure and skills to develop capability in application and use of a wide variety of behaviour-relevant data in security and defence provide thought leadership on theory-led, data-driven responses to insecurities, risks, threats and vulnerabilities develop and run open funding opportunities for small projects or activities in relevant areas improve and uphold standards, values and best practice of artificial intelligence systems and data access, use and analytics techniques, ensuring trustworthy, responsible, lawful and ethical practices and data use are employed across the network and the wider academic, government and industry communities by the end of the funding period, the network plus should have enabled a step-change in the connectivity and coordination of researchers and stakeholders in this field. it should have: generated new insights into data driven methods of understanding and predicting security risks, threats and vulnerabilities built new interdisciplinary capability in this area, linking existing and establishing new partnerships, bringing together new approaches and developing conceptual, methodological, theoretical and leadership skills enabled a coherent and connected behavioural science for security and defence landscape across disciplines, stakeholders and civil, homeland and national security sectors, by bridging existing structures, and by identifying needs through relationship building, co-creation, and sustained engagement informed policy, practice and understanding through engaging with stakeholder needs and enabling insights to feed into development processes for security policy, practice and new research the network plus will play an important strategic opportunities in the growing portfolio of investments under the ukri priority of building a secure and resilient world. the network plus will be expected to establish and maintain appropriate links with relevant esrc and ukri investments to achieve its aims of increasing collaborative working across disciplines, and connecting the research landscape. the successful investment will be expected to engage with the planned national capability for behavioural research, currently being commissioned by esrc, and the ukri building a secure and resilient world research and

is an nsf-led effort, implemented in partnership with like-minded international funders. the programme encourages and supports large-scale collaborative research on use-inspired themes in clean energy and climate change which foster solutions to address the global climate crisis. in this inaugural global centres funding opportunity, nsf have partnered with funding organisations in australia, canada, and the uk. the international funding organisations partnering with the uss nsf are: australia: csiro canada: nserc and sshrc uk: ukri in terms of this opportunity, use-inspired reflects the need for projects to focus on generating outcomes which have clear benefits for society in our efforts to tackle the global climate crisis. these outcomes should seek to generate novel clean energy solutions or help the assessment or mitigation of climate-change impacts on society, people, and communities. in this opportunity, for ukri funded projects, the term climate change is used to encompass areas such as improving the resilience and sustainability of our natural and physical environment and society to climate change, to biodiversity conservation and protection. it is also used to cover the adaptation of ecosystem services, to the use of innovative artificial intelligence (ai) and data science approaches as well as the development of new technologies for solutions in the face of a changing climate. more details on the specific areas ukri considers to be within the climate change scope for this funding opportunity is detailed below. this solicitation launches an ambitious new programme to fund international, interdisciplinary collaborative research centres that will apply best practices of broadening participation and community engagement to develop use-inspired research on clean energy and climate change. this programme will prioritise research collaborations fostering team science, community-engaged research, and use knowledge-to-action frameworks. the proposed research work should maximise the benefits of international, interdisciplinary collaborations. the proposed research can focus on delivering solutions not just for the countries partnering this opportunity, but which may be applicable at a global level. this opportunity is supported through ukris strategic theme building a green future, through which ukri is seeking to harness the uks research and innovation expertise. this strategic theme will address environmental challenges, overcoming technological, social and market barriers to deliver business growth, increased productivity and a prosperous green future for all. ukri funding for this opportunity will be utilised to create an ecosystem of global centres which thrive on international partnership. specifically, funding is available for uk based researchers to create global centre partnerships which must contain a partner in the us and could also include partners in canada or australia. a requirement of the ukri funding for this opportunity is that the uk component of the global centres proposal must be at least 65% focused on delivering clean energy solutions. uk proposals can either focus on clean energy or clean energy and climate change solutions. funding tracks in the framework of this opportunity, ukri is currently only able to support global centres partnerships which fit within the scope of the nsf solicitation category of track-1 awards which will be focused on clean energy and climate change topics. however, subject to budget availability, ukri may be able to support community-driven global centre design track-2 awards focused on clean energy and climate change topics. uk applicants interested in track-2 awards should check this page which will be updated periodically to reflect ukris position with this funding route. track-1: global centre implementation this route will support proposals to advance use-inspired research in climate change or clean energy that involve us teams supported by nsf, in collaboration with research teams supported by funding agencies based in australia, canada, or the uk. ukri is allocating up to 18 million over 5 years to support activities of eligible researchers across supported projects under this funding route. the ukri-supported elements of global centres implementation track-1 awards are expected to be up to 5 years in duration. number of successful awards are subject to the availability of funds. ukri expects to support the uk-components of between 3 to 5 global centres. due to the nature of this investment, additional reporting requirements and conditions may be applied to this investment. this will be reflected in the grant additional conditions, and those funded will need to comply with them. track-1 projects can be up to 5 years in duration and must start between 1 october 2023 and 31 december 2023. there will likely be a grant condition on end date to align with the 5-year maximum duration of track-1 projects. track-2: community-driven global centre design subject to budget availability, ukri may be able to support community-driven global centre design track-2 awards focused on clean energy and climate change topics. details on track-2 can be found on the nsf solicitation web page. uk applicants interested in track-2 awards should check this page which will be updated periodically to reflect ukris position with this funding route. ukri scope ukri has identified priority areas which it encourages potential participants within the uk research and innovation community to consider. ukri is particularly interested in supporting interdisciplinary research and innovation in the solutions which will be needed to overcome the last 20% of emissions we do not yet have a pathway to mitigate. these solutions must be developed and de-risked now to enable deployment in the 2030s and collaboration internally is key to delivering our outcomes. the uk has enshrined in law a binding target of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and 78% emissions reduction by 2035. a requirement of the ukri funding for this opportunity is that the uk component of the global centres proposal must be at least 65% focused on delivering clean energy solutions. uk proposals can either focus on clean energy or clean energy and climate change solutions. these themes include cross cutting considerations: the sustainability and circularity of the solutions proposed solutions need to be able to be implemented in a warmer climate with more extreme weather patterns energy demand reduction opportunities as energy efficiency and usage behaviours (green choices and green behaviours) will change as we decarbonise systems considerations solutions that also secure co-benefits such as enhanced biodiversity, resilient ecosystem services, improved air quality, health, and supply chain resilience for example clean energy theme ukri has identified 4 priority areas which we are particularly interested in seeing ideas in: negative emission technologies systems approaches to tackling the final 20% targeting the difficult to decarbonise removing the barriers to uptake of solutions priority area 1: negative emissions technologies this priority will focus on the discovery and development of new negative emissions technologies (nets) which are able to remove harmful pollutants such as greenhouse gases (ghgs) from our atmosphere at low concentrations. nets are mechanisms for the absorption and storage of carbon and other atmospheric ghgs. they are considered to be key to attaining net zero carbon emissions by removing ghgs from the atmosphere. it is anticipated that they could play a major opportunities in decarbonising energy-intensive industries, such as agriculture and cement production. there are uncertainties and concerns regarding the use of nets, such as the ability to develop and deploy nets at scale, and the wider ecological impacts of nets. this priority will include consideration of the next generation of negative emissions technologies including bioenergy (for example: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) and direct air carbon capture and storage. to support nets development, work will need to be undertaken to understand the efficiency, economics, environmental impacts of nets, and the public perception around climate change and nets. research into new policy, standards and regulatory recommendations will be needed to support the advancement of this area. it will also be important to explore the interactions between nature-based solutions and nets. for instance, this priority could address the development of new negative emissions technologies (across the spectrum of biosciences, engineering and physical sciences disciplines) which would provide a suite of options for deployment. through the development, the environmental impacts and the economics would be considered and be a key part in the development of a suite of solutions that could be deployed. priority area 2: systems approaches to tackling the final 20% this priority will ensure the adoption of a systems approach, whereby technologies, behaviours and interactions are at the forefront of achieving the final 20% of emission reduction. whole system modelling is key to enable informed decisions to optimise the system which has benefits in terms of resilience, sustainability, and both environmental and economic outcomes (to varying degrees) through the consideration of social, environmental, economic, technological, regulatory, political, and legal factors. there is potential to focus on: consumer acceptance and behavioural practices of net zero solutions design approaches to net zero development of circular systems and industrial symbiosis and understanding of the benefits and trade-offs they bring exploring the unintended consequences of deployment plans and the impact on the wider system, which can inform the research needed to tackle the last 20% infrastructure planning to avoid baking in further patterns resulting in future emissions new policy, standards and regulatory solutions systems integration considerations, considering the solutions in the context of the wider systems the opportunities of local in terms of communities driving change the opportunities of local in terms of local energy systems, local manufacturing etc. the opportunities of local in terms of local reuse and local remanufacturing reducing consumption and embodied emissions the technology coupling requirements based on the solutions currently being developed understanding of sustainable and equitable low-carbon behavioural practices for sustainable living and a just transition for instance, this priority could see activities focused on considering the system requirements for tackling the last 20% of emissions, considering the social, environmental, economic, technological, regulatory, political, and legal factors. activities could consider existing and proposed solutions and the impact of deployment at scale, and the system implications and trade-offs based on the options identified. priority area 3: targeting the difficult to decarbonise this priority will focus on the hardest to abate areas (heavy industry and heavy-duty transport, and the agri-food system) and securing decarbonisation and emissions reduction in the critical industries. there are still significant research challenges in these areas. there is established need to work on the gaps in existing research to tackle the hardest challenges where finding value for money solutions or alternatives that work at scale is vital to achieving net zero. these challenges include aviation and maritime, emissions from the agri-food system, chemical production, manufacture of cement, steel, glass, paper, and heating and cooling of buildings. there are also opportunities to consider other ghg reduction or removal approaches that could deliver the lowering of emissions needed to reach the uks net zero 2050 target. research opportunities to consider include: addressing consumer acceptance and behavioural practices of net zero solutions design approaches to net zero green choices and green behaviours land-based decision making new technological solutions for the heating and cooling of buildings, maximising the value of existing building stock new policy, standards and regulatory solutions novel materials discovery, transforming existing approaches and industries reducing consumption and increasing resource efficiency through circular approaches and more sustainable manufacturing reducing food waste reducing land-based and agricultural emissions substituting petrochemical process and products with those derived from biotechnology, covering the concept of biorefining for the manufacture of materials, chemicals and energy carriers understanding of sustainable and equitable low-carbon behavioural practices for sustainable living and a just transition for instance, this priority could see sector-specific activities focused on identifying the research challenges that need to be addressed to reach decarbonisation targets and lowering of emissions needed to meet global targets. for example, focusing on emissions from meat and land food production, could see suggestions for changes in approaches to production that would reduce embodied emissions. there may be activities focused here on capturing and creating value from emissions from current production approaches such as those covered by biorefining. priority area 4: removing the barriers to uptake of solutions this priority will ensure we focus on addressing the barriers to uptake through green choices and green behaviours, to technological and scientific solutions to barriers to current approaches which require further scientific exploration to maximise the potential value and impact of deployment of these interventions. the majority of the technical solutions for achieving net zero are already available but they are expensive or deliver poor performance. work is needed to improve the uptake of existing technologies through research and development to improve efficiency and reduce costs. this could focus on improving efficiency of heat pumps, developing low-powered computing solutions, and investigating business models including life-cycle analysis and techno-economic analysis, alongside policy, legislative and regulatory drivers to increase uptake of existing solutions. for instance, this priority could see activities focused on understanding the adoption and uptake of existing solutions and understanding the barriers that need to be addressed. this could also see consideration of small-scale demonstration activities such as living labs which see solutions being used in public to explore social patterns and the impacts. climate change theme in this opportunity, for ukri funded projects, the term climate change is used to encompass areas such as improving the resilience and sustainability of our natural and physical environment and society to climate change, to biodiversity conservation and protection. it is also used to cover the adaptation of ecosystem services, to the use of innovative (ai) and data science approaches as well as the development of new technologies for solutions in the face of a changing climate. this will have an emphasis on use inspired research and foreseeable benefits to society resulting from the project outcome. it will support international interdisciplinary collaborations to improve the resilience and sustainability of our natural and physical environment and society to climate change. these use inspired challenges recognise that our environment is both a source and a sink of ghg and our ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather events, leading to land degradation and loss in biodiversity and ecosystem services. there is a need for integrated solutions in the face of a changing climate and we encourage the use of innovative ai and data science approaches as well as the development of new technologies. as such, we are keen to encourage uk participation in the following areas listed in the nsf solicitation: biodiversity protection, conservation, restoration building knowledge and guidance into best practice and policy circular bioeconomy for food, feed, energy, and products climate ready, resilient agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries climate-ready resilient cities and infrastructures food and water resources and security on the changing planet economics, policy, social sciences for climate-resilience solutions ecosystem health and restoration engineered and

buildings. the uk must move away from gas as a source of heating space and water in buildings to meet its net zero commitments. the net zero heat programme focuses on the following three approaches: market demand: standardised information on what renovation to do, where and when for maximum impact system barriers: to bridge scaling gap leading to growth in supply chains and localised deployment design engineering: to reduce capital and installation cost across the system of net zero building upgrades and heat provision the aim of the innovation lab is to generate innovative and commercially viable new ideas. this will address the systemisation of delivery of net zero heat in buildings to make the process more efficient, effective and a lower cost. the innovation lab will invite individuals representing a cross-disciplinary of organisations to come together for 5 days. they will explore and propose new solutions, using whole systems thinking, approaching complexity in terms of wholes and relationships rather than by splitting it down into parts. the innovation lab will foster innovation and creativity in research design. it will provide a dedicated environment to allow participants to collaborate in designing and proposing novel projects. the project proposals may then be offered the opportunity to apply for funding support to carry out projects in a further separately assessed stage 3 application. we are looking for unique consortia to emerge, developing project ideas decarbonising and reducing the heat requirements of buildings through design and system engineering. project proposals developed at the innovation lab must centre on the following: a just transition, ensuring equality, diversity and inclusion is embedded in approaches to net zero heat in

potential of engineering biology, we will adopt a missions approach. each mission will set inspiring and stretching targets which focus the efforts of academia, industry and other partners, on complex problems which require a coordinated approach for successful delivery. ukri is inviting applications for: mission hubs in engineering biology, maximum funding of 13.1 million (100% full economic cost (fec)) for up to 60 months, with a further 1.15 million capital equipment available per proposal. mission awards in engineering biology, funding ranging from 0.6 million to 1.9 million (100% fec) for up to 24 months, with a further 20% as capital per proposal. ukri will fund 80% of the fec. there will be a single funding opportunity comprising two funding options spanning both mission hub and award opportunities, with a mandatory expression of interest closing 5 may 2023 and the deadline for full applications in july 2023 (to be confirmed). applications must be demonstrably in the field of engineering biology which ukri defines as: engineering biology is the application of (rigorous) engineering principles to the design and fabrication of biological components and systems, from modifications of natural systems to new forms of artificial biology. it encompasses the entire innovation ecosystem, from breakthrough synthetic biology research to translation and application. engineering biology mission areas each application to this funding opportunity must be focused on at least one of the following four engineering biology mission areas: 1. engineering biology for food systems delivering a more productive, sustainable and secure agriculture and food sector. this mission will address key challenges in agriculture and food including food and nutrition security, sustainability, and resilience. it will deliver transformative solutions that enable the agri-food system to be more sustainable, productive, diverse, resilient and healthy. 2. engineering biology for biomedicine delivering new therapies and diagnostics. engineering biology will provide new biologic therapies and new diagnostic tools. this will lead to improved health though prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases. this mission would enable development of novel technologies and solutions. it will transform and enhance our toolkit by which we can diagnose, prevent and fight disease. 3. engineering biology for clean growth delivering less carbon-intensive and more environmentally sustainable manufacturing processes and supply chains. this mission will present bio-manufacturing solutions, create sustainable and renewable supply chains, and develop efficient and smart power generation and storage solutions, increasing productivity and reducing carbon emissions. it will contribute to achieving the uk governments ambitious net zero targets. 4. engineering biology for environmental solutions supporting the diagnosis and cure of environmental issues. in this mission engineering biology technologies will be developed and applied to address challenges including bioremediation, waste management, carbon-capture, biomining, and resilient, biodiverse agri-environmental systems and ecosystems. for this specific opportunity projects must positively demonstrate that they are addressing one or more of the four missions. projects investigating disruptive approaches with broad applicability can be considered but must have a clear line of sight to at least one mission area. engineering biology opportunities: missions funds you will be invited to submit applications to the following opportunities for hubs or awards. hubs a maximum funding of 13.1 million (100% fec) for up to 60 months, with a further 1.15 million capital equipment available per proposal a hub should drive research and innovation (existing or new and novel) towards tangible mission-oriented impacts, including both commercial and societal. fundamental research may feature as a part of the programme. however, this should not be the primary focus of any individual hub. the hubs will be for up to five years and ukri will award up to 10.5 million (80% fec), with a further 1.15 million capital available per proposal. it is anticipated that one 60-month hub will be funded within each of the four mission areas (details above), subject to the review and assessment of the applications. in demonstrating the importance of the mission and how engineering biology can be exploited towards translation and commercialisation, we strongly encourage applications from consortia of suitable cross and multidisciplinary communities, seeking to work together to drive cutting-edge advances in engineering biology toward impacts in key sectors. appropriate consideration for industrial engagement and partnership on applications is anticipated, particularly on strands of research and innovation that are expected to have step-changing impact on markets and sectors. awards funding ranging from 0.6 million to 1.9 million (100% fec) for up to 24 months, with a further 20% as capital per proposal. building on existing strengths and emerging opportunities in engineering biology, these awards will also align with the four mission areas. they are not expected to be integrated with pre-existing hubs nor affiliated with applications submitted to the hubs opportunity above, but will be expected to act as sites of distributed research and innovation excellence, exploiting the potential of engineering biology and potentially focused on growing capacity and capability, in support of the four missions. the awards will be for up to two years and ukri will award funding in the range of 0.5 million to 1.5 million (80% fec), with a further 20% as capital per proposal. in comparison to the 60-month hubs, it is anticipated that these 24-month awards would have a focus on shorter-term developments for engineering biology in the uk. for example, a focus on the testing of existing technological solutions in new and novel contexts, or the establishment or growth of a new or nascent community and capabilities to create a platform for future uk growth. after 24 months, we anticipate that applicants will be able to demonstrate how the outcomes from this could serve as a springboard towards future opportunities.

emissions to net zero by 2050, and the uks levelling up agenda strives for everyone to live longer, healthier lives. led by arts and humanities disciplines, with interdisciplinary collaborations as needed, the theme will facilitate systematic exploration of the inextricable links between human health, ageing and wellbeing, environmental change, and place. frameworks such as one health, global health, ecological public health, ecosystem services, the planetary boundary (pb) concept and the nature/culture divide have been part of the discourse related to the concept of planetary health, whereby human wellbeing is dependent on the wellbeing of the earth, including living and non-living systems. the theme will address the interaction between environmental change, environmental factors such as lifestyle and place, and wellness and wellbeing for all, and will consider different socio-economic backgrounds and demographics (including age, gender, disability, and all other protected characteristics). ambition the themes ambitions, to be achieved using arts and humanities research, narrative, and innovation at doctoral level, are: address known and anticipated research skills gaps and shortages in this thematic area facilitate employability of doctoral graduates explore how arts and humanities contribute to a whole systems approach we particularly encourage applications which: use the lens of intergenerational justice to explore issues relating to health, ageing and wellbeing and the health of the environment explore how doctoral researchers can use deep storytelling methods and narrative methodologies to represent and engage with different perspectives on the theme explore the ways in which a place-led approach can improve our understanding of the complex relationship between people and the environment, and support the implementation of better outcomes for people and planet explore how arts and humanities disciplines can utilise data, machine learning and technology to improve our understanding of human health and wellbeing as well as the health of the environment, for example in relation to infectious diseases and zoonosis we hope that the outcomes of the provision will include: strengthening and diversifying the arts and humanities research talent pipeline, especially within the health humanities and environmental humanities a cohort and community of researchers well equipped with tools and knowledge to use arts and humanities approaches to address some of the complex and intersecting contemporary challenges rethinking the future aligned to a vision for responsible humanity as there are potential intersections with other strategic priorities for ahrc, including our work in cultural assets and supporting a thriving creative economy, applications could explore links with existing major ahrc programmes, for example health inequalities, place, story (storyarcs) and future observatory. studentship goals possible areas that students might pursue through the theme include the following, noting that this is not an exhaustive list: exploration of how the health, ageing and wellbeing of humans and the health of the environment are inextricably linked and how a place-sensitive lens, including local context and local knowledge, can ensure that we achieve better outcomes for people and the natural environment address the challenges that climate change and the ecological crisis pose to population health and wellbeing, in a way that enhances positive outcomes for people and the environment deepen our understanding of the opportunities of the environment within the process of ageing, including the natural and built environment, and how ageing can be supported to ensure wellbeing across all stages of life use the link between human and environmental health to shape ethical solutions to mitigate climate change impacts on health and wellbeing, and to support resilient communities research theme: cdts for the creative economy this theme builds on our growing portfolio in the creative industries and creative economy, contributing directly to our creative economy and cultural assets strategic priorities. the theme takes a broad view of the skills and expertise that contribute to a thriving cultural and creative sector and to grow the creative economy and explores how doctoral training can develop and enhance creative practice in different settings and contexts with positive impacts for diversity, skills, and growth. it is expected to utilise creative methodologies and collaborative approaches, widening the how and who of arts and humanities research for the creative economy. ambition the themes ambitions, to be achieved using arts and humanities research, narrative, and

health, ageing and wellbeing strategic priority, an initiative driven forward by all ukri research councils. scope the human functional genomics initiative aims to advance our understanding of the complexity of human physiology and how it changes over time and in disease, by exploiting recent advances in our ability to explore how genetic variation impacts complex phenotypes. this will enable the discovery and development of the next generation of genomically informed biomarkers, diagnostics, therapeutics, and preventative medicine strategies. this is a timely opportunity to support functional genomics research as the convergence of recent advances in gene-editing technology, multimodal functional assessment at scale, artificial intelligence, and effective cell-based model systems allows us to answer questions that have previously been impossible. in this initiative, we are seeking to fund a coordinated network of interdisciplinary clusters to drive a greater understanding of physiological pathways, organs and systems in both healthy and disease states through functional genomics research. the funded clusters are expected to complement each other, pro-actively coordinate across the initiative, work collaboratively, and provide access to the models, tools and data developed through the initiative on an open as possible, closed as necessary basis. read uk research and innovations (ukri) guidance on making your research data open. in addition to the clusters funded through this opportunity we will provide substantial ring-fenced funding to facilitate effective coordination across the initiative and with external partners, and support for platforms to curate, integrate and make available data generated via this initiative and related efforts. through this funding, we aim to: boost functional genomic capability develop causal models of biological processes in health and disease for functional assessment and validation develop new high throughput perturbation and readout technologies and tools for data analysis this will be underpinned by support for data integration and findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (fair) data standards for data discoverability and accessibility. where relevant, each cluster proposal should articulate: the key biological and methodological challenges in functional genomics to be addressed how you will draw on genetic insights to direct and inform your work. you should consider how you will address: health equity through population diversity of samples benefits of using diverse data in revealing new functional insights the limitations on the conclusions drawn from your own research and applicability of the research to uk and global populations how you will draw on or develop translatable models of human physiology across the life course for health and disease with a pathway, system, or organ focus. for example, this could include the use of longitudinal cohort or patient samples and data or development and validation of new technological approaches you should also explain the intended outputs and impacts of the cluster proposal: how your work will drive deeper mechanistic understanding of the interplay of genetic variance in physiological function across the life course for healthy and disease states, and the potential impact. for example, new biomarkers, clinical positioning hypothesis or novel targets how the cluster will address a capability gap in the uk functional genomics research landscape why you are best placed to deliver it how what you are doing will connect with other relevant initiatives what you could contribute to the initiative and to other researchers in the field, and what you would benefit from the initiative. for example: training knowledge exchange sharing of tools, models and data to be within scope, you must articulate an ambitious programme of work focused on human physiology in health and disease with clear potential to catalyse a step change in functional genomics research in a relevant biological context. the proposal could include, but is not limited to, the following: platforms using existing technologies at scale to interrogate functional readout of genetic variation, for example: genome perturbation multiscale and multimodal functional analysis functional and regulatory screening development of novel and emerging tools and technologies to enable functional genomics research, for example, perturbation technologies, analytical methods or data methods development and application of tools for analysis, comparative analysis and interpretation of functional genomics data. for example: bioinformatics computational biology and modelling artificial intelligence tools research focused on the interplay of genetic variance and physiological pathways, organs and systems in both healthy and disease states, including pursuing research in the correct biological context. for example: cell type physiological and developmental states stage of the life course dynamic and spatial context the development of relevant translatable biological models that seek to delineate causal pathways. for example, models could include primary or induced pluripotent stem cells from healthy and patient donors collaboration with both small and large companies is strongly encouraged but not mandatory, including appropriate cash or in-kind contribution to the cluster. you should also consider how the cluster will connect with and complement, rather than duplicate, existing infrastructure, initiatives and resources, including but not limited to: joint astrazeneca-cancer research horizons functional genomics centre human induced pluripotent stem cells initiative national institute for health and care research (nihr) bioresource nihr-mrc rare disease network genomics england 100k genomes project ukri artificial intelligence innovation to accelerate health research we will not support: functional genomics approaches in oncology, as there is existing uk investment and expertise in this area. the greatest identified need is for investment in non-oncology approaches. the use of cancer cells lines in non-oncology projects is permitted, where appropriate proposals solely focused on high throughput arrayed or pooled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr) screening. the overall initiative will include a recent mrc investment in an industry-partnered functional genomics facility (details will be announced in due course). this will provide the uk research community with high throughput arrayed crispr screening capacity, expertise and technical support applications should primarily focus on human biological models and cells. animal research that significantly enhances or complements activity may be considered, and, where appropriate, applicants are encouraged to engage with existing investments, for example, national mouse genetics

co-delivered the prosperity partnership funding opportunity aims to fund business-led research that arises from an industrial need, with the work being co-delivered between the business and project leads. the opportunity is aimed at supporting excellent, world-leading discovery research and innovation, which has clear benefit to the businesses involved, resulting in accelerated impact arising from the new knowledge, innovations, or technologies. co-creation of the research programme is essential. we expect programmes funded through this opportunity to: drive forward shared research challenges demonstrate impact beyond the partners provide benefits to the businesses involved the programme should contribute positively to the overall strategic partnership framework which exists between the parties. it should be clear that both the business and academic researchers are making distinct intellectual contributions to the partnership. where an individual is discharging responsibilities within both a business and a research organisation, for example, as a consequence of being involved in university spin-outs, clarity on separation of duties and managing conflicts of interest is essential. if the proposal is deemed appropriate for our support, a collaboration agreement will be requested before the grant is authorised. strategic considerations the research challenges to be addressed in the prosperity partnership should: be relevant to stimulating innovation aimed at tackling major problems faced by the uk and the world drive capability in key technologies and scientific advancements we recognise that the specific outcomes will be unique to each project, but you should consider how you might: deliver new or improved products or services drive efficiencies or cost reductions enable expansion to new sectors or markets while also jointly authoring high-impact publications ultimately, the project should seek to provide economic impact and prosperity that wouldnt exist without the partnership. place we seek to foster greater collaboration and networking between researchers, business, and civic bodies to deliver research, skills, and innovation vital to the long-term prosperity of communities and regions of the uk. while not an assessment criterion, we encourage you to consider and articulate how your partnership potentially aligns and supports both industrial and civic ambitions or priorities for regional economies. where applicable, you are also asked to demonstrate what place-based outcomes might be expected to arise from your projects, both in the short and longer term. these may include (but are not restricted to): local and regional economic growth, skills development, job creation or retention critical mass activities leading to increased private investment, including foreign direct investment, in a specific place contributions to cluster development through, for example, knowledge diffusion, supply chain development, small or medium-sized enterprise (sme) growth, generation, or growth of spin outs responsible innovation you are expected to work within the ukri framework for responsible innovation. you should consider and implement plans for responsible innovation throughout the research project, and include details of these plans in the application, including specific actions that will be taken. international collaboration applicants planning to include international collaborators on their proposal should view our trusted research guidance on getting the most out of international collaboration whilst protecting intellectual property, sensitive research, and personal information. scope the primary balance of research and innovation should be focused on bioscience and biotechnology which covers bbsrcs remit (at least 50%). other research and innovation areas supported by uk research and innovation (ukri) may be included if they clearly strengthen the research, innovation, or partnership. we encourage multidisciplinary research and recognises that many prosperity partnerships will involve multidisciplinary research and innovation. business and academic project leads should ensure that: the business and academic partners have a demonstrable emerging or established research-based relationship there are clear plans to evolve this relationship via user-inspired shared research challenges and the prosperity partnership is a key component of the plans to evolve and strengthen this relationship both partners are committed to the co-creation of a jointly delivered large scale research programme at technology readiness levels (trl) one to four the business and academic partners can commit to matching funding for the prosperity partnership with at least a matched contribution in cash (in-kind contributions are permitted but cannot form part of the matched component) a definitive list of eligible cash contributions is set out in the definitive list of eligible cash contributions for business leads and partners section no ukri, public, or government funding will be used as co-investment, and the partners are able to clearly demonstrate an auditable transfer during the grant duration the business lead must be: from a business in the private sector driven by profit or from an organisation with a commercial arm which generates independent revenue in a position to contribute to the nations prosperity through increasing their investment in uk based research and development activities and subsequent product development in the uk the topic of the research and innovation programme is primarily focused on bioscience and biotechnology within bbsrcs remit. multidisciplinary projects are welcomed and funding from other ukri councils may be sought as long as more than 50% of the topics or work lies within bbsrcs remit. this will be built into the assessment process, and we will provide indications to relevant councils immediately after the outline stage. matched cash contribution our funding is at 80% of the full economic cost with exceptions for skills and talent training costs (100% full economic cost). the funding we provide must be (as a minimum) matched with commercially generated revenue in cash by the business lead (in single lead bids). in multi-partner bids, this contribution can be collectively provided, but the majority has to come from a single business lead. cash contributions will count against the matched contribution. a definitive list of cash contributions can be found in the definitive list of eligible cash contributions for business leads and partners section. any contribution from business or other project partners not included in the cash contribution list will count as in-kind. we are happy to discuss contribution details prior to submission. where a prosperity partnership has a single business lead the full matched cash contribution (as a minimum) should be provided by the business lead. where a prosperity partnership has multiple business partners the combined cash contributions from the business partners must, at a minimum, match the bbsrc funding. the majority of this matched funding is required to be provided by the business lead for the partnership. it is permissible for the lead business to provide the entirety of the matched cash contribution and also have additional project partner contributions. once the matched cash contribution has been reached, additional contributions can be in cash or in-kind. for both single and multiple partner prosperity partnerships, there can be complex arrangements and objectives. where appropriate and necessary, we would be happy to consider and potentially discuss any necessary elements of proposals prior to submission. all bids cash contributions from all partners can exceed the matched cash contribution project requirement. in-kind contributions are any non-cash contribution from business, academic, or other project partners not included in the definitive list of eligible match contributions. in-kind contributions such as data, software, management time, and facilities access are strongly encouraged and can help show additional and varied business commitments to ensure the success of the project however, they will not count towards the matched cash contributions. any academic partner cash contributions (including those of the academic project lead) will not contribute to the matched cash funding project requirement. no ukri or other uk government money, as part of baseline funding or otherwise, may be used or included to form part of the matched cash contribution requirement. we will not mandate a specific audit format for the business contributions to a project. however, a formal record must be produced upon request. this must be able to demonstrate a continuous auditable cash transfer, or staff time-record, by the business partner per year in each year of the programme. as an exception, requests for skills and talent training are covered at 100% full economic cost so these need to be costed appropriately and considered for total matching of grant funding by the business partner(s). definitive list of eligible cash contributions for business leads and partners the following is the definitive list of eligible cash contributions. we expect the time of researchers, postdoctoral research associates, technicians, business-funded doctoral students, and the grant manager to be fully costed onto projects depending on how much time a person would spend on it. in the application, it is expected that the opportunities and responsibilities of costed persons are detailed, and it is demonstrated clearly how their experience and skills are linked to work packages and outcomes. the appropriateness of the time devoted to the project will be assessed in the panel interview and peer review (at the full proposal stage). gross salary can be claimed as matched funding (that is, including indirect costs such as pension, national insurance, and taxes) but not business overheads or profits. the salary of a single member of staff (researcher, postdoctoral research associates or grant manager) can be covered in partnership by the business lead and bbsrc funds in a ratio that best suits the project. below we state the eligible cash contributions for business leads and partners. researcher salaries all or part of the pro rata, gross salary cost associated with researchers employed by universities (including co-investigators). postdoctoral research associates salaries all or part of the gross salary cost associated with research associates employed by research organisations to work exclusively on the prosperity partnership. research associates can also be employed directly by the businesses in the partnership and the appropriately costed gross salary can be claimed as a cash contribution depending on how much time the person spends on the prosperity partnership. professional grant manager salaries pro rata gross salary cost of a professional grant manager. technician salaries pro rata gross salary cost of technicians. software licences new software licences needed for the project and their maintenance cost for the duration of the grant. software licences or intellectual property (ip) owned by the business which are already accessible by the partners will apply at marginal cost, not at market rate. new equipment equipment may be sought as part of the prosperity partnership and the equipment requested must be necessary to the successful delivery of the proposed research. items of multiple-use equipment (where the equipment is necessary for the pursuit of the proposed research but will not be fully occupied on it) may also be sought. the application must set out the other proposed uses and explain the overall benefit to bbsrc science of the equipment investment being sought. find out more in the bbsrc research grants guide. equipment produced by the business equipment produced by the business is only claimable at the cost of manufacture (not market) rate. access to equipment and facilities access to specific equipment and facilities critical to achieve the outcomes of the project. if the facility is based at the academic project or business leads facility, the cash contribution will be valued at cost. facilities development facilities development can be an eligible business cash contribution if the upgrade will increase the capability of the facilities with specific benefit to the proposed work. this contribution must be justified in addition to any estate costs already factored in. any facilities development contributions require discussion with us prior to submission. business cash donation business cash donations which will be provided to the partner universities, for the universities to manage in line with the project objectives. skills and talent training extra skills and talent training to support doctoral and research masters studentships, higher apprenticeships, continuing professional development of the projects research and innovation team, exchanges, and secondments. skills and talent training may be up to a maximum of 20% of the matching contribution. skills and talent training workforce development plan the workforce development plan will set out your aims, objectives, future actions, and anticipated outcomes for developing an excellent, inclusive, and supported team with the right people and the right skills to deliver the strategic objectives of the proposed prosperity partnership. it will describe any other added value actions the partnership will take to develop skills in the wider research and innovation community. the plan will set out what resources will be required and deployed to meet these goals. it will consider: the team of people needed to lead, implement, and support the prosperity partnerships work streams the depth and breadth of skills in the current team and how skills gaps will be addressed through continuing professional development or new recruitment the diversity profile of the team and measures to address any identified social and demographic imbalances opportunities for added value activities to train the next generation of researchers, technical specialists, entrepreneurs, and innovators to meet the ambitions of the workforce plan, skills and talent training activities should be costed into the main grant. examples of these activities include doctoral and research masters studentships, higher apprenticeships, continuing professional development of the projects research and innovation team, exchanges and secondments, and the development of training resources. these activities may be targeted to the core team assembled to deliver the prosperity partnership, or for the purpose of developing new talent for the sector at all levels and in all opportunitiess needed. note that any requests for doctoral or research masters studentships or higher apprenticeships based in academia must ensure that the projects allocated to these trainees will not be critical to the successful delivery of the prosperity partnerships strategic objectives. for any doctoral studentships requested, we expect that they receive cohort-based training by either aligning them with existing doctoral investments within the research organisation (for example, a doctoral training partnership or collaborative training partnership) or through new plans in this prosperity partnership for cohort-based training. details of these approaches will be required. we encourage you to follow the principles of the concordat to support the career development of researchers and the technician commitment. funding available and timeframe the full funding amount of at least 15 million will be delivered in a single round with projects being up to five years in length. bbsrc funding is at 80% full economic costs with exceptions for skills and talent training costs (100% full economic cost). requested funds may include: staff costs equipment and other items required to carry out the project costs related to impact travel and subsistence skills and talent training costs please see the bbsrc research grants guide for

opportunity is to: provide strategic investment in uk capital infrastructure deliver a step change in research capability proposed assets will likely create or offer a novel addition or improvement to an existing capability and will fulfil strategic research needs beyond those aligned to individual research projects. specifically, this funding opportunity will support the procurement of equipment. numerous capital assets have previously been funded by nerc through strategic environmental science capital investments. these competitive grant awards have been used to improve the environmental research landscape in different ways, including increasing capacity and enabling more efficient sample analysis; improving precision in measurements; and enabling the development, implementation or both of novel monitoring techniques. applications are invited for capital assets which: enable significant and world class environmental research to be undertaken that would otherwise not have been possible and have the potential to stimulate innovation and economic impact support nercs environmental science remit (see nercs environmental science remit) demonstrate a commitment to embed sustainability within the project in line with nercs commitment to sustainable research provide maximum positive impact over both short and long timescales. have a useful life exceeding one year create or build upon a new capability rather than maintain or duplicate an existing capability, unless evidence is provided as to why this is appropriate the headings below provide further details about any application you make. single assets applications must be for a single asset (one per application). individual components forming a suite of equipment are allowable only if they form a single asset. you must consider the full lifecycle costs beyond this grant and that they must be acquired elsewhere. this includes all operational and ongoing staff costs. you must also consider: whether there is enough demand for the asset methods for ensuring strong governance of the asset embedded incentives to ensure efficient and effective use of the asset in the long-term capital requests can include justified labour costs required for creating the asset (where evidence is provided that these costs cannot be met elsewhere). however, resource costs are not allowed, which includes staffing costs related to operation and maintenance of the asset (after the creation of the asset) and user training. avoiding asset duplication applications should avoid duplication of equipment. where the asset requested is a duplicate, a strong case must be made as to: why the pre-existing asset is insufficient to meet required capability or user demand why the asset outlined in the application should be funded you must refer to: the details of capital assets funded under previous grants the national equipment database other available equipment sharing databases equipment must be made available to multiple users through equipment sharing and assets must be listed on the above-mentioned database. use of equipment in multidisciplinary research areas is welcomed, whilst meeting nercs environmental science remit. equality, diversity and inclusion considerations equality, diversity and inclusion should be appropriately considered in the design and planned use of the asset, and should be explained in your response to the sustainability question. we are committed to achieving equality of opportunity for all funding applicants. we encourage applications from a diverse range of researchers. we support people to work in a way that suits their personal circumstances. this includes: career breaks support for people with caring responsibilities flexible working alternative working patterns find out more about equality, diversity and inclusion at ukri and nercs diversity and inclusion action plan. environmental sustainability of your proposed asset the application must adequately consider environmental impact, including demonstrating evidence that the potential of environmental harm from both procurement and ongoing operation has been considered. considerations should include, for example: energy use, conservation and management asset lifecycle (such as end-to-end use, end-of-life opportunities and decommissioning) evidence of actions taken to minimise potential harm and maximise benefit (for example, actions taken to reduce carbon emissions) should also be clearly demonstrated. see how to apply for more information. see the responsible research section for more details. consideration of place and levelling up we have long supported access to cutting edge and diverse capital and infrastructure for the environmental sciences community across the uk. you should consider how your proposed asset may potentially benefit the local place or region where the asset is located. this can be demonstrated within your answers to the vision, approach and sustainability sections. this may include, but not be limited to the following aspects (noting that not all will be relevant to your application): unlocking potential innovation and local economic growth job creation, skills development, development of capability users in the local area and other areas in the uk not typically in receipt of significant levels of research funding, thereby enabling excellent research and innovation and increased capacity driving local and place-based environmental and social benefits this is in support of uk research and innovation (ukri)s strategic priorities to: ensure the uk has cutting edge research and innovation (r&i) infrastructures enable r&i capability across regions support a diversity of institutions and a diverse portfolio as part of its world-class places objective duration the duration of this award is a maximum of 36 months. projects cannot start before 1 april 2024. we will work with the successful applicants to determine an appropriate start date to meet our profiled payment needs. funding available the fec of your project can be between 350,000 and 750,000 (including vat). we will fund 100% of the fec for capital equipment, and associated costs. see what we will fund. you must provide three equipment quotes for equipment costing over 138,000. where you believe that there are fewer than three potential suppliers for an item, you should provide a brief explanation as to why fewer than three quotations were obtained. a single grant will be awarded to the lead research organisation. applications that request contributions to an already planned asset, or that will be co-funded by an institute to deliver the requested asset, should not include institute contributions in the total grant value. in such instances, you must clearly state in your answer to the resources and cost justification section: how much funding has been acquired from elsewhere how much funding is being requested from nerc these applications will require sign off from your institutes finance director (or equivalent) and if your application is successful then we will request a letter of support. we reserve the right to work with successful applicants to determine the spend profile. what we will fund for this funding opportunity, your application must: create new or build upon existing equipment support nercs environmental science remit capital costs can include labour and development costs associated with the creation of the asset such as: transport delivery installation these costs must be entered under the equipment fund heading only. a clear case must be made as to how any suite of equipment will collectively form a single asset. support from industry partners in the form of expertise (in-kind support) or leveraged funding (financial support) is welcomed as evidence of increased asset impact and reach. what we will not fund the following costs are not eligible for this call: phd studentship costs staff costs will not be funded on

funding such infrastructure) services and facilities (see services and facilities section) services and facilities you cannot request the use of nerc scientific support and facilities (s&f) under this funding opportunity. applications that will provide capital assets for nerc s&f are welcome, however these must be discussed with the facility lead and the appropriate centre contact. applications supporting nerc s&f must be coordinated and should not represent multiple requests for the same capital asset unless evidence for sufficient demand can be provided and prior consent given by nerc. if the application is not from the facility lead, but from, for example, a node of the facility, then the s&f lead must be listed as a project partner. the relevant centre contact must also be informed of the application. this will ensure that any applications from within facilities are coordinated. supporting skills and talent we encourage you to follow the principles of the concordat to support the career development of researchers and the technician commitment. as one of the funders to sign the technician commitment, nerc recognises the value of technical expertise to the uk workforce. to reflect this, we welcome applications from all eligible faculty staff as either project lead or project co-leads. postdoctoral research assistants involved in the development of the application can be included as a researcher co-lead. responsible research through our funding processes, we seek to make a positive contribution to society and the environment. this is not just through research outputs and outcomes but through the way in which research is conducted and facilities managed. all nerc grant holders are to adopt responsible research practices as set out in the nerc responsible business statement. responsible research is defined as reducing harm or enhancing benefit on the environment and society through effective management of research activities and facilities. specifically, this covers: the natural environment equality, diversity and inclusion you should consider the responsible research context of your project, not the host institution as a whole. you should take action to enhance your responsible research approach where practical and reasonable. research disruption due to covid-19 we recognise that the covid-19 pandemic has caused major interruptions and disruptions across our communities. we are committed to ensuring that individual applicants and their wider team, including partners and networks, are not penalised for any disruption to their career, such as: breaks and delays disruptive working patterns and conditions the loss of ongoing work opportunities changes that may have been caused by the pandemic reviewers and panel members will be advised to consider the unequal impacts that covid-19 related disruption might have had on the capability to deliver and career development of those individuals included in the application. they will be asked to consider the capability of the applicant and their wider team to deliver the research they are proposing. where disruptions have occurred, you can highlight this within your application if you wish, but there is no requirement to detail the specific circumstances that caused the disruption.

bridging responsible ai divides (braid) programme, led by professor ewa luger and professor shannon vallor. we are looking to fund projects that will undertake scoping and preparation work, building partnerships and mapping parts of the ai ecosystem that could be the focus of a future responsible ai demonstrator project. types of projects we want to fund while responsible ai is recognised by many as a laudable and necessary aim alongside effective regulation; its meaning in ai development, use and governance remains contested and unclear, beyond high-level appeals to ethical principles such as accountability, transparency, safety, justice or trustworthiness. clarifying and demonstrating the full potential of responsible ai research and practices requires more than top-down principles; it requires bottom-up evidence, grounded in concrete contexts of ai development and application. to that end, we invite you to propose a preliminary study of responsible ai research and practice as demonstrable in a well-scoped context for ai, such as: a particular organisation type and sector (for example hospital, bank, start-up, university, etc) particular settings (for example research lab, product team, classroom, city/region etc) particular use cases or applications (for example fraud detection, medical decision support, autonomous vehicle, image or video generation, etc) applications must set out a proposal to clarify what responsible ai might mean in the chosen context, covering at least three of the following: the potential for adoption and translation of existing responsible ai research, tools and practices into this context (for example, algorithmic audits, impact assessments, red-teaming exercises, model cards, ethics review boards) potential for new responsible ai knowledge, tools or practices to be developed in this context, or adapted for this ai context from other domains or histories barriers, opportunities and incentives to responsible ai in this context the network of actors, stakeholders, powers and interests in this context achievable goals and action-guiding criteria for responsible ai in this context successful proposals may adopt any appropriate research methods for achieving the study goal, including integration of knowledge and practices from the arts or humanities. in addition to access to ahrcs braid (bridging responsible ai divides) programme network and activities, funded applicants will benefit from cohort networking events designed to connect them with third-party, non-academic organisations that may present opportunities for future collaboration, exploration and demonstration of study findings. you must outline a clear vision for how the work proposed will deliver a sustainable legacy beyond the funding period of this award, regardless of whether additional funding is available. responsible ai demonstrators subject to ukri funding commitments, ahrc expects to fund a later round of demonstrator projects that will leverage outcomes from projects funded in this round to enable expansion and further articulation. it is the intention for further funding to be made available to take forward large-scale demonstrators that build upon these scoping projects, subject to spending review outcomes. the vision for a future call on responsible ai demonstrators is to promote responsible and ethical innovation, including the capture and dissemination of best practice, through the development and analysis of live projects in real-world settings. the ambition is to demonstrate the transformative power of embedding responsible, human-centered approaches and thinking at the earliest stages of the ai r&d pipeline, and across the ai lifecycle. demonstrators will bring together commercial, business-led or public and third sector challenges relating to ai governance and/or practice with technical knowledge and expertise and specialists in ai ethics to co-design and deliver jointly owned research plans. funding from ukri will help organisations to understand, manage, and responsibly govern risks that are inherent to ai technologies by testing different responsible and ethical tools or approaches in real-world conditions. this will enable new and innovative approaches to be piloted with the aim of improving contextual and/or general performance and societal outcomes. for more information on the background of this opportunity, go to the additional information section. duration the duration of this award is six months. projects must start by 1 february 2024. funding

approach to encourage the research use of adr england flagship datasets (pdf, 1.5mb) in partnership with five co-funders across three themes. adr england flagship datasets are national administrative datasets with coverage of at least england but potentially other uk nations for example, england and wales, great britain or uk data. the three community catalyst themes (children at risk of poor outcomes, youth transitions, and evaluation) have been selected to be cross-cutting areas that can use existing adr england flagship datasets to make a considerable contribution to social science. the themes also offer the opportunity for a collaborative space to open across government departmental and sectoral boundaries and to consider more holistic perspectives on an issue. it is the shared ambition of all co-funding parties that these awards will develop more self-sustaining, thriving, and well-networked communities of researchers connected with wider stakeholders that have a shared understanding of the gaps and priorities within each theme. we are offering funding for three community catalyst awards, one for each theme: adr england research community catalyst for children at risk of poor outcomes (co-funded by what works for early intervention & childrens social care) adr england research community catalyst for youth transitions (co-funded by youth futures foundation and the centre for transforming access and student outcomes in higher education) adr england research community catalyst for evaluation (co-funded by the evaluation task force and esrc) the community catalyst awards share the following objectives. each objective is expanded upon in both the main funding opportunity specification and each of the three theme-specific annexes. you should read both the main funding opportunity specification and the theme-specific annex to understand the requirements of this funding opportunity. objectives 1. strategic research leadership provide a focal point to consolidate the growing body of knowledge around the use of administrative data for research and inform future developments of the programme. this would include: mapping and consolidating existing research evidence, applications, concepts and case studies coordinating and co-designing a research agenda with key stakeholders that identifies and prioritises research topics using linked administrative data mapping accessible data sources that are required to address the research agenda. research agendas should build upon government departments areas of research interest 2. build capacity fort academic research using administrative data develop awareness of and interest, skills and confidence in using linked administrative data in a diverse network of academic administrative data researchers across institutions, career stages and disciplines. this would include supporting researchers to conduct data analyses using administrative datasets and coordinating the development of a training and resources hub. 3. develop a diverse administrative data research community to form, facilitate and empower a diverse community of data and research users to build meaningful and sustainable relationships around a shared sense of purpose. the community will come together to exchange knowledge and stimulate opportunities for collaboration. if such a community already exists, then to build upon this foundation. stakeholders include policymakers, decision-makers, data users, data owners, practitioners, researchers and others across academia, central and local government, parliament and the third sector (including advocacy groups, non-governmental organisations, charities, etc.). other priority stakeholders are included in the theme-specific annexes. 4. address research priorities via a delegated research budget as part of this award, provide opportunities for others to conduct small-scale research during the lifetime of this award. this research will increase the use of adr england linked administrative data via adr uk trusted research environments, with the aim of creating impactful case studies. this is to address gaps in the research agenda as well as contribute to the capacity building and community development objectives of this opportunity. due to the different amounts of co-funding and interests of the co-funders, we are trialling two different modes for allocating this delegated research budget. the children at risk of poor outcomes, and the youth transitions community catalysts will fund embedded fellowships supervised by their team to address research priorities. the evaluation community catalyst will manage a test and trial fund to support demonstration projects and use cases to address public policy evaluation challenges. funding the total funds available for each award, stipulated in the table below, are broken down into a maximum sum for the community catalyst core grant and a maximum sum for the delegated research budget. all figures are at 100% fec (unindexed) and inclusive of co-funding. table 1: maximum sum available by theme (100% fec  unindexed) children at risk of poor outcomes youth transitions

that all members will attend, and a steering group specific to each theme: 1. monitoring and evaluation group the monitoring and evaluation group, chaired by adr uk, will meet every six months and bring together all co-funders and grant holders from all themes plus a couple of key strategic and cross-cutting stakeholders. the three community catalysts will be required to submit a light-touch reporting template to allow the group to hold the awards to account on behalf of all funders (more details provided below under measures of success). the group will also evaluate the overall effectiveness of the community catalysts in meeting their objectives and support their success by: addressing cross-cutting issues maximising the potential overlap between themes identifying future opportunities, for example, for wider strategic alignment with external activity 2. community catalysts steering group each community catalyst will chair and administer a steering group that will comprise key strategic stakeholders in the sector identified by the co-funders (membership can be influenced by the grant holder too). the steering group will provide access to senior practice, policy and third sector partners and ensure the community catalysts remain well-aligned with the policy and practice priorities and developments. it is also anticipated that the membership of the steering groups will include third sector stakeholders or advocacy groups to provide a mechanism for public engagement. these steering groups will be convened two to four times per year and are a key vehicle for the community catalyst teams to consult on the development and delivery of their work plan throughout the award and to embed into the specific context of the theme. measures of success light touch

to increase environmental sustainability and achieve a more circular economy. however, digital technologies themselves have an environmental cost. therefore, solutions to both improve the sustainability of digital technologies and to enable application of digital technologies to drive towards a more sustainable and circular future are needed. this funding opportunity is intended to do just that by bringing together academics, industry and, small and medium sized enterprises (smes) to collaboratively build solutions that deliver against uk net zero, environmental, and digital futures targets. this epsrc funding opportunity aims to fund up to eight collaborative research programmes that contribute to the development of a digitally enabled circular economy and more sustainable digital technologies. through this funding opportunity, we are looking to invest in two interlinked areas of research: sustainable information communication technology (ict), research addressing novel approaches to the development of more environmentally sustainable and circular digital and communication technologies digitally enabled circular economy (ce), research developing digital solutions to enable a circular economy. research in this strand may support a circular economy in any sector and is not limited to the digital sector proposed research may integrate the two areas into one research programme. grants given under this funding opportunity will form part of a broader investment to build connections and research capacity in this area. in addition to these research grants, a network funding opportunity will launch later in 2023. networking across and beyond the funded projects, the network will drive further collaboration, relationship and capacity building at the interface of ce, ict and materials. our expectation is that grants funded under this funding opportunity will collaborate with the network investment. this strategic epsrc investment will bring together uk world leading capabilities in ict, materials science and engineering, and ce research. harnessing the opportunity for collaborative research across these interfaces will deliver significant impact for the uk, supporting epsrcs engineering net zero and digital futures priority ambitions. find details of this in our strategic delivery plan. through our engineering net zero priority we aim to deliver systems approaches and solutions to: use the earths resources as efficiently as possible eliminate pollution and contributions to landfill help deliver a sustainable zero carbon future through our digital futures priority, we aim to deliver digital software and hardware tools or solutions that: enable a resilient, environmentally sustainable and secure by design digital future for the uk enable positive economic impact for the uk opportunity objectives the successful projects will address epsrcs strategic aims by delivering against the following objectives: deliver world leading and impactful collaborative research, which is co-created across the circular economy, materials, and ict communities build capacity and foster relationships at the interface between the circular economy, materials, and ict communities, increasing understanding and consideration of circularity and sustainability in the ict and materials communities support the development of new circular ict products, technologies and business opportunities which have a reduced environmental footprint and more resilient supply chains support the acceleration of the transition to a circular economy through the development of digitally enabled circular technologies, products and systems embed consideration of a circular economy into the sustainable development of future materials support the longer term uptake of circular economy and sustainability considerations and practices by industrial partners what we expect to see in applications this cross disciplinary funding opportunity will support programmes driving knowledge exchange and collaboration across ict, materials science and ce communities to deliver a more sustainable, resilient and circular future. the proposed research must demonstrably lie primarily within epsrcs remit. however, we welcome and encourage the involvement of researchers from other disciplines (including those from other ukri councils). programmes should be co-created and co-delivered with appropriately interdisciplinary collaborators who can provide further understanding of the contextual factors that influence the systems. programmes must: address a timely research challenge focused on one, or both, highlighted areas of research: environmentally sustainable ict or a digitally enabled circular economy demonstrate a coherent strategic vision and bring together a collaborative and world leading academic team with relevant stakeholders to address it drive added value as a core focus of the programme by demonstrating synergistic connectivity between disciplines take a systems approach, considering the wider context in which the proposed research and research outcomes will sit, as well as the risks, costs and trade-offs associated with different materials, technologies, processes and approaches; use tools and approaches such as life cycle analysis and impact assessments where appropriate include appropriate co-creation and collaboration with stakeholders such as industry, policy and the third sector to identify and develop a timely and strategically important research application identify and embed clear, realistic and proportionate routes to enable environmental, economic and societal impact, as appropriate for the project, as well as translation pathways that will maximise demonstrable impact from the programme in the short, medium and longer term develop the skills of the researchers and partners involved, embedding equality, diversity and inclusion (edi) as well as

its programme of work in a responsible fashion according to best practice in responsible research and innovation proactively engage with the network, other investments made under the funding opportunity and the wider portfolio. building in resource to appropriately engage and network with the wider grant cohort and associated network investment over the grants lifespan is expected novelty and excellence can be accomplished through bringing together expertise and addressing the areas in new ways as well as through furthering the state of the art. sustainable ict this area welcomes research addressing novel approaches to the development of more environmentally sustainable and circular digital and communication technologies. each application in this area must have a primary research challenge that is driven by the challenges of delivering more circular and environmentally sustainable digital and communication technologies, from a hardware and/or software perspective. environmental sustainability may include consideration of such broad areas as: reducing carbon emissions protecting and enhancing the natural environment and biodiversity waste or pollution elimination resource efficiency and circular economy environmental sustainability is complex and there are often conflicting drivers. applications may consider any one or more of these areas as a core focus, but all are expected to consider the circularity of the proposed research output as part of the programme. we particularly encourage applications that consider tighter loops of circularity, retaining components, materials and resources at their highest value for as long as possible. the proposed research under this area may include, but is not limited to, the development of: software hardware hardware-software co-design novel materials tighter loops modular and interoperable systems the following articulates some key research challenges involved in delivering more environmentally sustainable and circular digital and communications technologies, one or more of which may be addressed by an application. it is not an exhaustive list and applications need not be restricted to these areas: design of novel materials, components and products for circular ict, including consideration of extending life, end of life, re-use, repair, disassembly and remanufacture recovery of products and materials from in-use ict components for re-use in novel ict, so as to retain value in the system research into more environmentally responsible ways to store, use or share data from a hardware and software perspective concurrent design of hardware and software to enable more energy efficient ict systems, including hardware and software codesign and ai/ml enabled software -hardware codesign novel software, software engineering or improved existing software designed to reduce environmental impact, for example, in terms of the environmental impact of the software itself via reduced energy usage or similar digitally enabled circular economy this area welcomes research addressing the development of digital and communication technologies to support the transition to a circular economy and the economic, social and environmental benefits it enables. there are many different definitions of a circular economy. at its heart, ukri considers it to be about: producing less keeping the products, materials, and resources we do use and produce in circulation at their highest value for as long as possible recovering resources after use applications in this theme will have a core vision and primary research challenge driven directly by the challenges of delivering a circular economy and the economic, social and environmental benefits it enables. we will accept applications in any sector or sectors or considering any resource flow or flows. applications solely focused on the development of ict which could be used in the ce but where enabling a ce is not a core focus and vision are not eligible. applications could include: use or application of: data digital tools models technologies such as: software simulation artificial intelligence machine or deep learning sensors or other hardware to develop new technologies, products, processes, tools and materials required to realise the environmental, economic and social benefits of a circular economy. the following articulates some of the key digital challenges to achieving a circular economy, one or more of which may be addressed by an application. it is by no means an exhaustive list and applications need not be restricted to these areas: design of new digital tools to support more efficient recycling technologies including more effective separation and sorting of mixed waste streams development of digital product passport technology for tracking components through life new digital software, tools, technologies, models or application of data to enable: effective and appropriate life cycle analysis across the innovation lifecycle more efficient material flow analysis to identify waste that would go unaccounted for in conventional economic monitoring systems better and more efficient decision-making at the end of first life we particularly encourage applications that consider tighter loops of circularity, retaining components, materials and resources at their highest value for as long as possible. digital technologies are not without an environmental cost. all applications should consider any environmental trade-offs of the proposed approach, as well as the circularity of any proposed technology or system as part of the programme. systems approach you must place your research in the context of the wider system (technological, economic, social, cultural, and environmental) in which the proposed research outputs would sit. these aspects should inform and influence the research direction of the proposed programme throughout its lifetime. you are not asked to research the entire system or necessarily carry out systems engineering but should: define the system or systems they are developing consider the systems that their system will sit within and interact with, and the feedback loops this may generate. these may be upstream or downstream of your system and at similar or different scales consider the wider social, legal, regulatory, economic and environmental context you should consider questions such as: how does your research influence or impact other parts of the system you are developing? how could other systems influence or impact your system, technology or process? what further research might be needed for your technology or process to have the desired impact in a current or future system? your programme may not necessarily deliver this further research, but it should look to identify it and consider the implications of it a shift to a more circular economy provides an opportunity for the uk to achieve more sustainable and clean economic growth and prosperity. however, implementing it within the current uk system may not always be the most appropriate approach. programmes will need to take a systems approach to enable consideration of the trade-offs, risks and mitigations associated with different approaches using tools and approaches such as life cycle analysis and impact assessments where appropriate. user engagement we encourage you to engage with research users in the conception and implementation of the proposed projects to maximise research impact where appropriate. these can include: industrial partners policymakers research institutes third sector organisations environmental sustainability ukris environmental sustainability strategy lays out our ambition to actively lead environmental sustainability across our sectors. this includes a vision to ensure that all major investment and funding decisions we make are directly informed by environmental sustainability, recognising environmental benefits as well as potential for environmental harm. in alignment with this, ukri is tackling the challenge of environmental sustainability through our building a green future strategic theme. this aims to develop whole-systems solutions to improve the health of our environment and deliver net zero, securing prosperity across the whole of the uk. environmental sustainability is a broad term but may include consideration of such broad areas as: reducing carbon emissions protecting and enhancing the natural environment and biodiversity waste or pollution elimination resource efficiency and a circular economy epsrc (on behalf of ukri) expects programmes to embed careful consideration of environmental sustainability at all stages of the research and innovation process and throughout the lifetime of the grant. programmes should ensure that environmental impact and mitigation of the proposed research approaches and programme operations, as well as the associated project outputs and outcomes, is considered. programmes must also seek opportunities to influence others and leave a legacy of environmental sustainability within the broader operations of their academic and industry partners. duration the duration of this award is up to three years. funding available the full economic cost of your project can be up to 1.8 million. epsrc will fund 80% of the full economic cost. what we will not fund we will not fund research if: the majority of the research is outside of epsrc remit; we will reject applications deemed to have a majority remit within another ukri council: epsrc reserves the right to make such remit decisions without reference to peer review the majority of the research programme fits to a singular discipline, with other disciplines being secondary, add on, or not integral to the research project in the digitally enabled circular economy area,k work is focused on the development of ict that has the potential to be used in the ce, but where enabling a ce is not a core focus and vision we will not permit substantial changes to the applications aims, vision or core focus between the outline and full stages without our prior permission. equipment funding equipment over 10,000 in value (including vat) is not available through this funding opportunity. you should list smaller items of equipment (individually under 10,000) under the directly incurred  other costs heading. for more information on equipment funding, read epsrcs approach to equipment funding. supporting skills and talent we encourage you to follow the principles of the concordat to support the career development of researchers and the technician commitment. international collaboration if your application includes international applicants, project partners or collaborators, visit trusted research for more information on effective international collaboration. upcoming network opportunity we will establish a network to support the creation of a new research community at the ce, materials science and engineering, and ict research interfaces, and to bring together the projects funded through this funding opportunity. the network will support communities working along the same or similar research themes, but will have a stronger focus on community, skills and impact. the network funding opportunity is scheduled to open in august 2023. applicants to this research opportunity will also be eligible to apply for the network grant. we expect that projects funded under this funding opportunity will collaborate with the network investment. applications should build in resource to appropriately engage with the associated network investment and the wider grant cohort over the grants lifespan.

since then, the data landscape has changed substantially. for example: a greater focus is placed on the importance of sharing code as well as data more emphasis is given to linked data sources including social media and administrative data trusted research environments (tres) are improving access to the most sensitive data the existing data policy and associated processes to deliver this reflect a time when researchers relied mainly on using established survey data or primary data to undertake their research. the emergence of new sources of data and methodologies for using and sharing such data require the current policy to be refreshed to ensure it remains fit-for-purpose and that: researchers are adequately supported throughout the research data lifecycle in order to manage their data effectively data can be shared within ethical and legal considerations, under appropriate licensing to ensure wider access and adhere to fair (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) principles methods to create data resources are transparent, reproducible and can be used seamlessly by others all data that are used for social science research are in scope for this programme of work. recommendations recommendations for updating the policy will need to include the means to implement it, in alignment with the esrc data infrastructure strategy and other relevant esrc and uk research and innovation (ukri) strategies and policies. esrc is part of ukri and as such any recommendations should link into relevant cross-ukri and council strategy, policy and infrastructure

other data professionals, technologists, others as seen fit consult with services offering access to a wide variety of data types. consult across sectors to take on board best practice and

implemented). this includes (but is not limited to): tres research code production and sharing the increasing and vast array of data sources (and the associated structured and unstructured nature of them) research ready data and the processing and expertise required to ready it synthetic data an evolving legal and ethical landscape consisting of different types of data and methods of licencing diverse methodologies applied to different types of data to ensure the avoidance of bias in data and thus research outcomes data principles and standards gather a set of requirements and develop

cost should not be included in the funding costs. laptops may be costed where a new member of staff (for example, a fellow) who is employed purely for the grant will require this, or where a higher specification is required for the completion of specific grant related activities such as data modelling or enhanced graphics. these costs should be applied for under directly incurred other costs. relocation and visas applicants moving to the uk from overseas to take up an award may request relocation and visa costs including immigration health surcharge (ihs) and certificate of sponsorship.
