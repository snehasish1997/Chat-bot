# Chatbot Using GPT-4 and Pinecone Vector Database

This project is a chatbot application built using OpenAI's GPT-4 model and Pinecone, a vector database for machine learning applications. It serves as an interactive platform capable of understanding and responding to user queries in a conversational manner.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Leverages the advanced capabilities of GPT-4 for natural language processing.
- **Vector Search**: Implements Pinecone for efficient similarity search in conversation context.
- **Multi-File Support**: Extracts text from PDFs, Word documents, and images to include in the chat context.
- **Scalable Backend**: Structured to handle multiple simultaneous conversations.
