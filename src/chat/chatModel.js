// This file would define the schema for your chat messages and export the model.
// For example, if you were using MongoDB with Mongoose, it might look something like this:

const mongoose = require('../database');

const chatSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  user: String,
  message: String,
  timestamp: Date
});

const Chat = mongoose.model('Chat', chatSchema);

module.exports = Chat;
